<h1>The Best Movies According to Heike</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Dirty Dancing</h3>
<p>An all-time classic that reminds me of my early youth</p>

<h3>Shining</h3>
<p>A real good horror movie. In my mind Jack Nicholson in one of his best roles</p>

<h3>The silence of the lambs</h3>
<p>When I watched this thriller with Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, I wanted to become an agent of the FBI like Starling</p>
